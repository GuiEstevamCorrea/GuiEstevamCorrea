# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Greetings! I'm Guilherme Correa, a passionate development enthusiast dedicated to crafting innovative solutions and constantly expanding my expertise in cutting-edge technologies.

## 🚀 About Me

In the last few years, I've embraced a diverse role as a full-stack developer, exploring various technologies to architect innovative solutions. My current focus lies in back-end development, where I leverage Java, Spring, Typescript, and Node.js. I bring solid experience in handling a variety of SQL and NoSQL solutions and databases.

My education in Systems Analysis and Development at Anhembi Morumbi laid a robust foundation, further enriched by my experiences as a Freelance Full Stack Developer and Full Stack Analyst.

Throughout my academic journey and ongoing studies in Software Engineering, I've honed significant skills that find application in my role as a software developer. This skill set equips me to tackle complex challenges and contribute effective solutions for project growth.
