# Welcome to my GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Guilherme Correa and I am a developer passionate about creating innovative solutions and always learning new technologies.

Over the last few years, I have been working as a full stack developer, exploring different technologies to create innovative solutions. Currently, I continue to work with full stack development, where I mainly use Java, Spring, .NET, ASP.NET, Node.js and React.js. In this position, I have the opportunity to work with different solutions and SQL and NoSQL databases.

In addition to my training in Systems Analysis and Development at Anhembi Morumbi, I bring a valuable wealth of knowledge from my experiences as a Freelance Full Stack Developer and Full Stack Analyst.

During my graduation and in my current studies in Software Engineering, I developed skills in this area that were consolidated in my work as a software developer.
With this combination of skills, I am prepared to face complex challenges and contribute effective solutions for project growth.
